<h1>Auto Loan Credit Decisioning Model</h1>

<h3>Team Members:</h3>

## Background:
An auto loan is a type of secured credit that allows consumers to borrow money to purchase a vehicle, with said vehicle used as collateral on the loan. Prospective borrowers may apply for an auto loan individually or jointly. Joint borrowers are typically spouses, or a child and a parent. Borrowers repay the loan in fixed installments over a set period, with interest charged on the outstanding balance amount. Defaulting on the loan could cause considerable damage to a person's credit score and impact their future creditworthiness.

## Setting:
Assuming that we are working in the consumer lending modeling team of a hypothetical financial institution and are assigned a task to enhance the current application decisioning process with a focus on providing equal credit lending opportunity to all applicants. We want to build a credit decisioning model based on the Auto Loan applicants' credit quality information. The model will aim to identify the applicants with good credit quality and unlikely to default.

## Information Provided:
We are given Auto Loan account data containing one binary response called 'bad_flag' in the datasets and a set of potential predictor variables from those Auto Loan accounts. Each record represents a unique account. There are two datasets: 1. Training data with around 21,000 records 2. Testing data with around 5,400 accounts.

## Objectives:
- Conducting an exploratory analysis to provide data summaries and necessary pre-processing for modeling.
- Developing and assessing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Stacking Models.
- Comparing the results from these models to recommend the most effective approach for approving loan applications.
- Addressing critical business questions related to model transparency, gender bias, and potential racial discrimination.

## Dataset Description: 

- Number of Features: 42
- Target Variables: bad\_flag
- Pre-Processing: Removing columns with more than 80% missing values, capping outliers, scaling features, encoding categorical features, removing correlated features with high correlation threshold.

## Model Overview:

Models Explored: 

Logistic Regression: Base model
Random Forest
Balanced Random Forest
XGBoost
Stacking Ensemble (Random Forest and XGBoost as base learners and Logistic Regression as meta learner) (final choice)


Performance Metrics:

      Models were compared based on recall (class 1, bad loans), PR AUC and fairness metrics.
